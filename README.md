[Hydra](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/) is a web platform to share your example files from Grasshopper and Dynamo.

The project is inspired by http://bl.ocks.org/

Hydra is started at the [2015 AEC TECH Hackathon](http://aec-technology-hackathon-2015.devpost.com/) and was one of the two winners for best collaboration and opensource development.
